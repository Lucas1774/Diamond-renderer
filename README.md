THIS WAS A COLLEGE PROJECT. IT WAS ORIGINALLY COMPILED BY A CUSTOM C++ SUBSET DEDICATED COMPILER.

## Program

This was the very first code I ever wrote, it was a fun one, but I ended up kind of forcing my way through it. Maybe a little too much for someone zero days deep into programming. Notice the iterator naming.  
The fact that it's not actually compiled by a c++ compiler but rather by a compiler for a made-up language that my university uses for whatever reason (I have a couple of wild guesses) didn't help either. I was completely lost syntax-wise.  
IIRC it renders it half by half, and every half quarter by quarter. Now that I come to think of it this isn't necessary. Goes to prove how good of a looping practice this was
